<!DOCTYPE html>
<!--
    If you do not select the line to specify the document version (the <!DOCTYPE> reference),
     the browser will activate the so-called Quirks Mode.

    In Quirks Mode, the browser attempts to process the page in a manner similar to the way older browsers handled web pages,
     including errors and non-standard behavior.
    This happens because the browser thinks that you might expect it to display the page as it appeared in older browsers.

    If you specify the line for the document version correctly (such as <!DOCTYPE html>),
     the browser will follow Standards Mode, displaying the page according to modern web standards.

    So it's always a good idea to specify <!DOCTYPE> at the beginning of the HTML document to ensure the page displays correctly and is fresh.
